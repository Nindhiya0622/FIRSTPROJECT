      <h3>Project One</h3>
      <p>Throughout my journey as a Full Stack Developer, I’ve worked on several projects that allowed me to combine creativity with technology. One of my key projects is a Student Management System, designed to simplify academic administration through an intuitive interface that helps manage student data, attendance, and reports effortlessly. I also built a dynamic E-Commerce Website that offers users a seamless online shopping experience — complete with product filtering, secure checkout, and an admin panel for inventory management. To showcase my skills and growth, I created my own Portfolio Website, a fully responsive and interactive space that reflects my passion for coding, design, and continuous learning. Each project has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of how great design and clean code work together to create impactful digital experiences.</p>

      <h3>Project Two</h3>
      <p>As a Full Stack Developer, I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems while allowing me to explore new technologies. One of my major projects is an Online Learning Platform, where students can enroll in courses, take quizzes, and track their progress through a clean and responsive interface. I also developed a Personal Finance Tracker, designed to help users manage their daily expenses, visualize spending patterns, and plan budgets effectively. Another exciting project is a Task Management App, created to help users organize their day-to-day goals with reminders and progress tracking. In addition, I worked on an Online Food Ordering System, which connects restaurants and customers through a simple, interactive web interface with real-time order tracking. Each of these projects helped me strengthen my problem-solving, backend integration, and front-end design skills, while also fueling my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences that make people’s lives easier.</p>
